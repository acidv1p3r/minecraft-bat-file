This bat file is a pre-optimized script that you can use to start hosting your Minecraft server with improved performance. It's very easy to use - just drag and drop the file into your Minecraft server folder and run it.

If you have a different name for your server file, you'll need to rename it to "server.jar" or update the script with your new name. Once you're ready to start your server, simply run the script and it will allocate the appropriate amount of RAM and start the server with optimal Java flags.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for further improvements, you can reach out to the creator at contact@acidv1p3r.com. or Join our Discord Server: discord.gg/RgZGCqKxAb
